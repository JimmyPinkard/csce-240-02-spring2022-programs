Generalized Legislator information

Link: https://www.scstatehouse.gov/legislatorssearch.php

Prompt the user for their address, city, and zip code
After that get the list of legislators and links to their page. Then ask which one they want to know about.
Once we do that we can store the information about the legislator in a JSON object.
Then we can ask the user what they want to know about them.
Then turn the JSON data into text.
